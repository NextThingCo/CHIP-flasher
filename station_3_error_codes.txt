302	Turn on wlan0
303	Turn on wlan1
304	Hardware list
305	I2C bus 0
306	I2C bus 1
307	I2C bus 2
308	testing AXP209 on I2C bus 0
309	GPIO expander test
310	Doing 10s stress test
311	Wifi enumeration test
312	Checking bitflips on NAND


352	Turn on wlan0 - test not found
353	Turn on wlan1 - test not found
354	Hardware list - test not found
355	I2C bus 0 - test not found
356	I2C bus 1 - test not found
357	I2C bus 2 - test not found
358	testing AXP209 on I2C bus 0 - test not found
359	GPIO expander test - test not found
360	Doing 10s stress test - test not found

362	Checking bitflips on NAND - test not found

Notes:
301 remains the same as before
302 has been replaced with all of the new ones
353-361 should never occur
362 will happen if we test a CHIP that doesn't have the nand test code on it
